A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
-About Me, this section describing personal background
-Profile section with image
-Projects page listing projects with clickable links to GitHub repositories
-Navigation menu linking Home and Projects pages
-Contact Me section with clickable email link
-Font Awesome GitHub icons next to projects links
-Resume page displaying a full pdf resume
-Navigation menu linking Home, Projects, and Resume pages

(b) CSS features

(c) Advanced features
-A responsive hamburger menu navigation for small screens (it collapses the main navigation into a toggleable menu when the screen is minimized).
-Use nested CSS selectors to style the navigation menu and item sections.
-Embedded PDF resume using an iframe, allowing the full resume to be view


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I initially encountered some accessibility and validation bugs, including code formatting errors and missing required elements. All of these issues have been fixed. For example, one problem was that the width and height properties of the iframe didn't accept percentage values, so I updated them to use valid numerical values ​​and implemented responsive layout via CSS.
